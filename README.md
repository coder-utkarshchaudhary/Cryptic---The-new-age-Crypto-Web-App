# **Cryptic---The-new-age-Crypto-Web-App**

## **Intoduction:**
This project is made as a part of the "EXECUTE 3.0" hackthon organized by Delhi Technological University (DTU)🏫🏫. Our project is a new age cryptocurrency and AI powered web app that brings the flexibility and power of **AI**🤖 with the unwavering trust of **crypto sites like CoinGecko, Binance, Metamask etc.**<br><br>

## **Problem Statement**
#### *Problem Statement 1* : AI based algorithm for recommending cryptocurrencies<br><br>💻🖥️

## **Proposed Solution**
Our team decided to make a web app that is powered by APIs to fetch cryptocurrency data and an advanced LSTM model to make predictions. The overview of the site is as follows:
- Recommendations Section - The best performers and worst performers are determined by the underlying LSTM model which gives the **name**, **symbol** and the **predicted rise/fall** in the currency.📉📉📈📈
- View All Currencies - This section lists all the currencies on out platform. Hovering over a particular currency gives amazing insights into the selected coin.🪙🪙
- Personalise CRYPTI - The *holy grail* of crypti.... The ability to modify and train the LSTM model to suit your needs and more importantly **your data**.👨‍💻👨‍💻
- About Us - This section details the team of people and the solution we have implemented.⚙️🛠️
- Developers - All the fellow coders, join in to be a part of the LSTM Dev team and give your inputs to make the app better. Access APIs, servers and stored data in your projects by accessing the developers section. 🤳📱**(Under construction)**🏗️🏗️
- Forum - Discuss the booming crypto trends and new coins with other CRYPTI's in the vibrant forum. **(Under construction)**

## **Innovations**
CRYPTIC is not just your everyday cryptocurrency web app. It is made for everyone... from an analyst to a developer, from a newbie to a profession🚀🚀. It caters to the need of all.<br>
1. The addition of CRPTI, the chatbot, anyone unfamiliar to the world of crypto can dive in and start trading. The bot can be used to ask questions, learn trading concepts and seek help while using the services on the app.✨
2. The best part about CRYPTI, apart from being free :), is the possible modifications to the underlying model. Got your unique data? Or some particular ideas about the model architecture?
